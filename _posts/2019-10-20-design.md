Currently, most Internet based companies are conducting A/B tests. For example, Uber loves to use A/B test to roll out new features, Facebook uses the in-house A/B test system to check the success of marketing campaign. At Ritual, we are conducting statistical test backed A/B test analysis to rollout products and improve our marketing strategies.

Based on our use cases, variables might be grouped into three categories, following binomial distribution, poisson distribution and gaussian distribution.

One common mistake that people may make is to use aggregated mean to roll out features. It is not appropriate since variables follow drastically different distributions may share the same mean. And it is dangerous to conclude experiment based on a single parameter without any statistical tests. To make our life easier, T test may be 

## Frequentist Approach

Regarding variables, the test are designed by normal distribution approximation. That is to say, instead of checking distribution itself, it is easier to look at parameters we are interested in.

The current solution is, end users designate the baseline parameters and the framework would enable them to pivot by group of interests.


## Bayesian Approach

Compared with frequentist approach, Bayesian statistics provided a more understandable approach to A/B tests analysis. In this approach, I used a little code block from Looker but it turns out this approach is relatively difficult.

## Looker Implementation
To rollout the system faster, BI tools, like Looker might be a better choice compared with programming approaches. I was inspired by multiple blog from Looker. Links are shared in the end.
