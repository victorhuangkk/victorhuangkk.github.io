## Summary

There are huge amount of blogs


## Technical Preparations

This is a very personal suggestions for people want to step into data science field. I would suppose you have <1 year coding experience and haven't being trained rigorously in computer science or statistics.

If that's the case, this road map may help you to learn statistical data science in the hard way. Most of the time, newbies would ask, Python or R, MySQL or BigQuery, Logistic Regression or Decision Tree, etc. Based on my limited experience, the question should be reformulated as what is the more suitable way to approach the problem, what's the motivation for this model, what's the best strategy to answer the business question? Of course, tools are important in the middle but end goal should be prioritized. I would give out some personal suggestions in terms of preparations.

### Programming

As a data scientist, you are highly likely to be asked to write Python independently. For example, your manager need a well organized report to unveil a trend. Or, you are asked to prototype/develop a recommendation system. Or, the marketing team need an optimized list of customers to send emails. There are many requests haven't being mentioned here but you may get the flavor. You may solve those questions in any script languages. I am using Python. I was exposed to Python in the wrong way. After several years of coding, I suggest learners pick the language in the hard way. It may take you about 3-6 months to finish all the materials but it would pay back later.

You may find all the materials online. First is to read through Dalio's guide to Python and the latest version of Python tutorial. They would help you understand how the language works. Then, numpy and pandas official tutorials would become your best friends. Read them a few times would save you tons of time on stack overflow. Then, read a few coding style guide, cookbook and good repo would level up your skills fast. Computer science data structure algorithms would not be your core skills but them helps a lot to optimize your code.


### SQL
SQL is data science's mother language. Nobody would help you to fetch data and summarize them

### Business Sense and KPI


### Statistics


### Machine Learning and Mathematical Optimization



## Daily Life
