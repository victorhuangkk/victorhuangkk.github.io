Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A     
Research Analyst (Intern)     
July 2018 – December 2018

1. Algorithmic Trading

  - Implemented algorithms in _Quantopian_ and _Zipline_ to back-test and trade stocks weekly based on volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and fundamental factors including Price/Earnings ratio and ROE (return on equity).
  - Increased 46 % for the performance of the $8 billion portfolio based on the Sharpe ratio of weekly return compared with the current strategy.

2. Real-Time Stock Data Analysis   

  - Led a four-people team by coordinating the group assignment, monitoring the project progress and presenting to the director of factor research in the organization every week.
  - Implemented and enabled the calculation of the risk exposures, bid-ask spread and volume using more than 3TB&#39;s data from _OneTick_ and _MSCI_.
  - Developed a dashboard in Python(_flask_) and Javascript to display real time impact of news on stocks&#39; price and calculate the marginal utility.
  - Optimized the stock portfolios based on daily equity data with reinforcement learning and convex optimization.

**UCLA Anderson School of Management**   
Los Angeles, CA, USA.    
Graduate Researcher - Operational Research      
May 2018 – September 2018

- Developed a package to be published in CRAN-R project to perform constrained and unconstrained optimization for tree models.
- The package could solve large-scale mixed integer optimization with heuristic methods including greedy algorithms and simulated annealing, Benders decomposition and split generation of constraints algorithms.
- The _Tree Ensemble Optimization_ package is able to optimize numerical, categorical and mixed variable type problems.
- First co-authored a manuscript to be submitted to the Journal _of Statistical Software_.

### PROJECTS
 **Prototype Selection for Nearest Neighbor Classification**      
    - Implemented a relaxed integer program and random rounding algorithm in Python with _numpy_ and _cxvpy_ to identify prototype set, which is an NP-hard problem. Implemented the key components for the R package _protoclass_ in Python with a greedy heuristic approach.       
    - Modified integer linear program&#39;s objective function and constraints to improve the efficiency and precision.

      - Implemented frontend Dashboard in _ShinyR_. Integrate with database by _dbplyr_ and deployed on _GCP_.
      - Provided product marketing team business insights and boost merchant closing rate by 50%.

 **Marketing Recommender System**      
      - Use Python (_Ibis_) framework and _Airflow_ to implement data pipelines.       
      - Implemented micro-services in Python to calculate user similarity score by Singular Value Decomposition (_SVD_).
