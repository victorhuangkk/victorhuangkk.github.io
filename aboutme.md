- I am a data scientist at Ritual. Before joining this fast growing Toronto based startup, I got degrees at U Pitt and UCLA. During that period, I did multiple researches in theoretical chemistry and optimization's application in machine learning.

- I love :octocat:, R, Python. Love statistics and math. Love experimental design and Bayesian statistics.
